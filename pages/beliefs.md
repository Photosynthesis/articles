### Belief

1. Beliefs are tools we can use to relate to the world
2. Which beliefs we choose should be guided by something that includes as much context as possible, which could be called *wisdom*
3. Usually, the best beliefs accord with what can be most shown to be most true and real
4. We can choose beliefs for their goodness and beauty, constrained by the above
5. It can be reasonable to have unreasonable beliefs
6. Summary: epistemology is important, useful, complex

### Life
1. Life is a process of continual evolution, change, experimentation
2. Life guides itself by desire, appreciation, wonder, awe, and joy (and also with the guardrails and change-makers of pain, sorrow, anger, fear)
3. Life and god can be two words for the same
4. Life is audacious in its experiments
5. Life is conservative in its parallelism
6. Life probably can -- probably wants to -- surprise itself

### Duality
1. Duality is fundamental, as is the non--duality that encompasses it
2. The interplay of opposites and polarities is a driver of aliveness -- polarity is a choice, and often a good one

### Evil
1. Pain is a necessary and healthy signal and part of life and evolution, and:
2. Pain can get stuck and try to replicate itself, to avoid itself
3. Evil is self-replicating pain
4. It is present at many many scales
5. Systems of self-replicating pain can become parasitic or damaging to life
6. Healthy systems: 1) attend to and don't encyst or other the pain within them, and even befriend it 2) protect themselves from pain systems external to them

### Feminine and masculine
1. Like all abstractions, feminine and masculine are only conditionally real, even if epistemically useful
2. The masculine tends toward the abstract, transcendent, structured, controlling, propositional, utilitarian, universal, linear, penetrating, eternal
3. The feminine tends toward the immanent, concrete, flowing, local, embodied, emergent, complex, enfolding, present-instant
4. Both polarities have contextually healthy and unhealthy expressions, and are embodied by each person and cultural system, to differing degrees
5. The healthy interplay of these poles supports life to sustain, evolve, and flourish at all scales
6. Ill-health of either pole or unhealthy domination causes life to lose vitality

### Patriarchy
- Unhealthy patriarchy is an imbalance and ill-health of this polarity in which the unhealthy masculine dominates the healthy feminine, causing ill-health to life
2. Unhealthy patriarchy has spread virus-like through and with the spread of civilizations
3. This can be seen in many domains, including knowledge production, religion, more-than-human relations, community, and between males and females
4. Everywhere the specific, local, embodied, complex, immanent has been colonized by the abstract, mechanistic, utilitarian, controlling, propositional
5. This has lead to great suffering and ill-health for humans and most other forms of life
6. Patriarchy continues to infect its individual human hosts, male and female, and the systems they operate in, particularly economic systems, and wreak havoc on the rest of life

### Religion
1. Religions grew from the basic human drive to understand and connect
2. Religions that spread widely are generally patriarchal at many layers
3. To find healthy forms of human collective spirituality, it needs to become more local, specific, embodied, feminine
